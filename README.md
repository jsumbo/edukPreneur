### Problem Statement

Liberiaâ€™s secondary education system lacks integration with practical skills and real-world applications, particularly in entrepreneurship. This gap leaves students inadequately prepared for the workforce and entrepreneurial ventures, resulting in limited career opportunities and economic growth.

### Why is it a Problem?

Skills Gap: Students graduate with theoretical knowledge but lack practical entrepreneurial skills that are crucial for modern job markets and self-employment.
Limited Opportunities: Without entrepreneurship education, students miss out on valuable opportunities to develop innovative ideas and create businesses.
Economic Impact: The lack of a robust entrepreneurial ecosystem limits economic development and job creation, contributing to higher unemployment rates and slower economic growth.

### Proposed Solution:
Edukpreneur addresses this problem by integrating entrepreneurship education directly into the secondary school curriculum through a dedicated web application. The platform provides:

Entrepreneurship Modules: Practical courses that teach students essential business skills, such as business planning, financial management, and innovation.
Interactive Learning: Engaging lessons and projects that apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
Resource Access: Tools, templates, and mentorship connections to support students in developing and launching their own ventures.
Career Pathways: Opportunities for internships and apprenticeships that bridge the gap between education and employment.
